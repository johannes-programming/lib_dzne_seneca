# BASE (Brain Antibody Sequence Evaluation)

The program can be used both through the shell and through its GUI.
Both interfaces are designed to have the same structure.
Almost everything, that is possible in the shell is also possible in the GUI.
The biggest difference is that in the shell only one task can be performed
with one run of the program.
The GUI allows for an indefinite number of tasks in every run.
